This project is a web-based application that will utilize Gradescope to keep track of assignments, grades, due dates, and other statistics and analyze them for convenience, features that Gradescope currently does not have.

In order to run:
1. Clone repo
   ```git clone ______```
3. Install necessary components
   ```
   pip install flask
   pip install gradescopeapi
   ```
4. Run the following command
  ```
  python -m flask --app main run
  ```
5. Login using BU email and password (this doesn't support Boston University SSO, so you have to create a password using the Gradescope settings)
