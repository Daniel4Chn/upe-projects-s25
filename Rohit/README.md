Liar's Dice

This project is by Rohit Mandapati and Justin Shi

We used the Godot Engine to recreate the game liar's dice. In this,
the player faces off against 4 AI players, dynamically created each
game so that no game ever feels the same. Learn your opponents and
figure out their patterns, learn how risky or safe they play. 

To play this, once you've downloaded the the repository, it's as
simple as running the executable. If you are on Windows, run
Liars Dice.exe and if you're on MacOS, run Liars Dice.dmg. There
is a rule book in game that explains the game. Good luck!
